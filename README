This repo contains a set of scripts I use to help me manage my Banshee (b)
music library, including pushing to Google Play Music (gm).

Long term, the plan is to migrate all the Banshee stuff into a Python
module and then write a tool to push Banshee metadata to Google Music
(leaving the file upload and download to Google Music Manager), probably
via https://github.com/simon-weber/Mirror-MediaMonkey-to-Google-Music.
