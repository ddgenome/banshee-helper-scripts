This repo contains a set of scripts I use to help me manage my Banshee (b)
music library, including syncing with Google Play Music (gm).

Long term, the plan is to migrate all the Banshee stuff into a Python
module and then write a tool to sync Banshee metadata with Google Music
(leaving the file upload and download to Google Music Manager).

banshee-db-sync.pl        set playcount information from old library to new one
banshee-fs-diff.pl        consistency check between database and file system
banshee-gm.py             push banshee information to google music
banshee-playlist.pl       extract playlists from banshee library
banshee-recent.pl         list recently played or added banshee tracks
banshee-uri.pl            correct uri of tracks (one off script)
