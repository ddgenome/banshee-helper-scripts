This repo contains a set of scripts I use to help me manage my Banshee (b)
music library, including syncing with Google Play Music (gm).

Long term, the plan is to migrate all the Banshee stuff into a Python
module and then write a tool to sync Banshee metadata with Google Music
(leaving the file upload and download to Google Music Manager).
